A prototype made in Unity/C# using Aura 2 for lighting & fog. This is essentially a variation of a prototype I built earlier for a work project. 

There's an indicator in the lower left corner of the screen which dynamically reacts to the spectrum data of the sound source in the tower.

All sounds recorded by me. The train model is part of the Steam City asset pack from Unity Asset Store.
